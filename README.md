This is a repo housing the site contents for my personal webpage - hosted through GitHub Pages. 

This codebase was originally based on a static-file export of a localhost WordPress install used for development work and research on block editor customization. Meaningful customization has now been done to maintain and renovate various elements.



## Notes

A few quick credits for various third party items used in the current public version of the site:
